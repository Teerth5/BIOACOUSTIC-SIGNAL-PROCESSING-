Animal Sound Classification - A Machine Learning Approach

This project explores building a machine learning model to classify animal sounds from audio recordings. Here's a concise overview of the workflow, methodology, and techniques used:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Audio files (.wav format) are loaded from a designated directory.
Each audio file is assumed to belong to one of the specified animal classes (e.g., cat, dog, bird, etc.).
The following libraries are used for data loading and manipulation:
Pandas: for data management (if using a CSV file to store audio paths).
SciPy's wavfile: for reading WAV files.
Feature Extraction

For each audio file:
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is computed to represent the audio signal as a time-frequency domain spectrogram.
Standardize the spectrogram using a StandardScaler to normalize feature values and improve model performance.
Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to select the most informative features and reduce computational complexity (optional).
Model Training and Evaluation

Features extracted from the training set are used to train a machine learning model.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel is employed in this example. Other classifiers like Random Forest or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) could also be explored.
The model is evaluated using:
Classification Report: provides precision, recall, F1-score for each class.
Accuracy Score: measures the overall percentage of correct predictions.
Scikit-learn library is used for splitting data, model training, and evaluation metrics.
Prediction and Visualization

A new audio file can be provided for classification.
The model predicts the animal class based on the extracted features.
Optionally, an image corresponding to the predicted animal class can be displayed (using libraries like OpenCV).
Overall Approach

This project demonstrates a fundamental framework for classifying animal sounds using audio processing, machine learning techniques, and potential visualization.

Note:

This is a simplified example, and more advanced techniques might be needed for robust performance with real-world audio datasets.
Hyperparameter tuning of the model can significantly impact classifier accuracy. Experiment with different parameters to optimize performance.
